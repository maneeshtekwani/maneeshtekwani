- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maneeshtekwani and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at The George Washington University. At GW, I am gaining hands-on experience with tools such as PostgreSQL, Python, and R. Through the application of these tools, I am actively involved in developing databases and creating visualizations to assist sponsors in describing their status quo, predicting consumer trends, and prescribing strategic approaches for future growth. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in analytics and its applications in varied business sectors such as Operations, Product, and Supply Chain Management.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R for the purpose of Regression Analysis, ANOVA and ANACOVA Models; SQL for Database Development and Visualizations; and Python to Training/Testing Models and build visualizations.
  
- ðŸ“«  Please have a look at some projects I've been working on within my Github repository and hope to connect! Reach me at my email: maneeshtekwani@gmail.com
